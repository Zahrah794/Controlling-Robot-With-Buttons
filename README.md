# Controlling-Robot-With-Buttons


## Description
To enable control over a robot's movement, you can implement a user interface with five buttons: forward, backward, left, right, and stop. When a user presses one of these buttons, the corresponding movement command is stored in a database for future reference. Additionally, a PHP page can be created to retrieve the last recorded movement of the robot.
